In preparation for the bigger ride in a few months, I thought it'd be good to test out bike touring
on a well supported route over a few days. The Katy Trail was the perfect opportunity for this. It is
the longest rail-to-trail conversion, and runs from St. Louis to Clinton, Missouri.

The total distance I ended up covering was 500 km over 4 days. I felt as though I ran through it a bit quick, averaging
about 140 km the first three days, and 80 on the last one heading back to Sedalia from Clinton.

## Reflection

Alltogether, it was great to see a lot of the countryside in middle America. A lot of farmland, small towns, and friendly
people on the trail. Some main highlights were the capital of Missouri, Jefferson City, markers for the Lewis and Clark
expedition, and forest packed full of all sorts of birds, snakes, insects, and deer.
